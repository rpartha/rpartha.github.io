<p>Looking for a new game to play during quarantine season? Say no more, because <em>Hidden Through Time</em> by Crazy Monkey Studios
is a relaxing yet challenging hand-drawn puzzle game through time that recently piqued my interest. If you&#39;ve 
ever played <em>Hidden Folks (2017)</em>  or the <em>Where’s Waldo?</em> books, this game should be right up your alley. The game itself is 
dead simple: you are presented with objects, people, and/or animals at the bottom of the screen, and if you locate enough of them, 
you get to progress to the next level.  </p>
<p>There are 26 levels in the base game, each grouped into one of the following time periods: Stone Age, Ancient Egypt, Medievel Europe, 
and American Wild West. Once you&#39;ve completed these levels, you can play 10 more levels in the Viking Tales DLC, set in the era of,
you guessed it, Vikings. Splitting up the game like this not only makes it more visually pleasing, but also prevents it from becoming 
repetitive since every time period has a unique way of hiding things in a scene which in turn forces you to adapt to the new visual language of 
the level. </p>
<p>Everything is mostly where you&#39;d expect them to be, but should you find yourself stuck, the built-in hint system that can be found by hovering 
over the object, person, or animal at the bottom of the screen should point you in the right direction. This is actually a genius idea because you 
are only provided with <em>barely enough</em> information as to where it might be, so you&#39;ll still have to do most of the digging.</p>
<p>What really sets this game apart from similar games, though, is the ability to create your own levels and upload them for other people to play. The editor is just
drag-and-drop, so it should be fairly easy to use. If you don&#39;t feel like making your own levels, there are a plethora of other people&#39;s levels for
you to download, try, and rate. You even have the option to favorite specific levels. I haven&#39;t made my own, but I had a blast trying out what other 
people had made.  </p>
<p>The base game can be found on Steam (Windows and MacOS), the Nintendo Switch, PS4, and Xbox One for <strong>$7.99</strong>, on Google Play for <strong>$2.99</strong>, and on the
iOS App Store for <strong>$1.99</strong>. The Viking Tales DLC can be had for an additional <strong>$1.00</strong> on the iOS App Store and Google Play, and <strong>$1.99</strong> everywhere
else. The game (including DLC) takes about 4-6 hours to complete. </p><p><a href="../">←</a></p><div class="footer"><p class="toggle-theme"><a href="#" onclick="toggleTheme(event)">Dark</a></p><p class="blurb">
