I have since been making waves as a back-end dev over <a href="http://stonewain.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ Stonewain Systems, Inc</a>. 
For the past decade and counting, I have been learning and practicing the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Tabla" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tabla</a> under the guidance of Dr. Pratik Devasthale. Earlier this year, I have recieved a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhil_Bharatiya_Gandharva_Mahavidyalaya_Mandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visharad Purna</a> (the equivalent of a Bachelor's degree) for it. In my spare time, I like to sharpen my technical skillset to improve and
expand on top of the knowledge I possess. Apart from that, I very much enjoy going on hikes and outings with friends, 
watching my favorite shows, and casually gaming. Some of the shows I currently watch include Brooklyn Nine-Nine, 
The Flash, The Mandalorian, and Altered Carbon. If you liked what you read so far, please take a look around.</p><p><a href="../">←</a></p><div class="footer"><p class="toggle-theme"><a href="#" onclick="toggleTheme(event)">Dark</a></p><p class="blurb">
