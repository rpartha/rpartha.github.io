# Getting Started

Please go through my [blog post](https://ssgram.dev/writings/getting-started-with-harp) to set this up for yourself.
This is NOT a starter template.

# Forking and/or Cloning

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, plagiarism is bad. It's always disheartening whenever I   
find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and   
designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as   
your own. You can use this code for your own site _**with proper attribution**_.
